        <p>
            The transition to green energy grids depends on detailed wind and solar forecasts to optimize the siting and
            scheduling of renewable energy generation. Operational forecasts from numerical weather prediction models,
            however, only have a spatial resolution of 10 to 20-km, which leads to suboptimal usage and development of
            renewable energy farms. Weather scientists have been developing super-resolution (SR) methods to increase
            the
            resolution, but often rely on simple interpolation techniques or computationally expensive differential
            equation-based models. Recently, machine learning-based models, specifically the physics-informed
            resolution-enhancing generative adversarial network (PhIREGAN), have outperformed traditional downscaling
            methods. We provide a thorough and extensible benchmark of leading deep learning-based super-resolution
            techniques, including the enhanced super-resolution generative adversarial network (ESRGAN) and an enhanced
            deep
            super-resolution (EDSR) network, on wind and solar data. We accompany the benchmark with a novel public,
            processed, and machine learning-ready dataset for benchmarking super-resolution methods on wind and solar
            data.

        <p>Our results indicate that the perception-distortion trade-off holds for the super-resolution of wind and
            solar
            data. Our benchmark shows that CNN-based image-processing techniques (e.g., EDSR) are likely to achieve
            higher
            image similarity (in MAE, RMSE, PSNR, SSIM) while GAN-based methods achieve higher spectral similarity. We
            show
            that GAN-based models have significant applications in climate scenarios, as they most reliably generate
            results
            that match the spectral dynamics of the ground truth. Of the two GAN-based models benchmarked, ESRGAN
            performs
            best in super-resolving solar data whereas PhIREGAN performs best for wind data.</p>

        <p>In future works, we will extend the benchmark to stochastic super-resolution techniques such as variational
            auto-encoders (VAEs), normalizing flows, and diffusion-based models and metrics such as CRPS. Additionally,
            assessing these models on their ability to preserve temporal consistency across consecutive frames by
            focusing
            on spatiotemporal super-resolution will more comprehensively represent the physical fidelity of outputs.
            Validating these models on data outside of NREL's WIND Toolkit and NSRDB will also widen the scope of this
            study
            and evaluate their generalization to various locations and timespans.</p>
